- **User Interface:** A user-friendly interface provides options to Resume, Save, Load, and Quit the game. Persistent saving capability ensures that progress is retained, even after quitting the game.

- **Level Design:** The game features a sandbox environment with multiple levels, each with a unique set of objectives. Players must complete these objectives to progress towards the main quest, providing an engaging and immersive gameplay experience.
